# Prototype checks

Run `npm test` from the prototype root. Python checks cover real game behavior and
error reporting. Node checks cover tutor edit validation and the HTTP/API boundary
with a fake upstream response; they do not spend API credits. Browser smoke checks
are performed separately against the running local prototype.

Return to the [prototype README](../README.md).
